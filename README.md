# Text-Compression
An ASCII compressor/decompressor using Huffman's Algorithm

Two compression outputs are available. By default, Binary2.cpp is built when the make is run. Binary2.cpp enables actual binary being written to the output file of the compression program, Huffman. Using Binary1.cpp makes huffman write an ASCII representation of the binary output by Huffman. Unhuffman will convert either format back to text.
